//Progression 1:
//We've got some basic info about Karen's home
//Debug the type of data provided
//Return the types concatenated in a single variable
function moreAboutHome(address,distanceFromTown,hasNeighbours)
{
	var condatatypes=typeof(address)+typeof(distanceFromTown)+typeof(hasNeighbours)
	return condatatypes;

//Progression 2:
//Check if the data given is of the right type
//parents = String, noOfSiblings = Number, isNuclearFamily = Boolean
var count ,c;

{
	count++;
	nasNeighbours--;

//Progression 3:
//Lily is suspicious about Karen's new friend
lily>=karen's new friend;
//Karen tells her friend's age and even writes it down
consloe.log(karen.age)
//Check which one those is not a number (NaN) and return that value
var a=NaN;
//Progression 4:
//Lily gave Karen x sweets
karen=x sweets
//Karen ate y sweets herself
 y.sweets=karen
//On her way to the river, she ate another z sweets every n meters travelled
she.z=sweets;
she-n meters;

//Her friend divided the remaining sweets into 2 parts for each
she-n/2
//How many sweets did her friend get to eat?
she-n
//Progression 5:
//As Lily moves closer, it gets colder. She checks the temperature on her mobile
lil==colder
//It only shows in fahrenheit. Convert the data to celsius and return it.
fahrenheit=>celsius
//Progression 6:
//Lily can now do multiple things to deal with this
lily*deal
//1. Take her daughter to a doctor
lili<=doctor
//2. Talk to her husband about it
doctor=>husband
//3. Counsel her daughter herself
daughter<=council
//4. Lock her daughter in her room
daughter.lock
//Given a value, return which of these above actions Lily would take
lily*deal
//Progression 7:
//Lily realized that she'd hurt her daughter
lily!=daughter
//All she wants now is for her to stop crying
all=crying
//She refuses to talk to her but Lily doesn't stop trying
talk=doesn't stop crying
//She tries out multiple things hoping for the best
she.best
//Take all of Lily's strategies and concatenate them to a single var
lily+single
//Seperate the strategies by a single space

//Return the length of the complete strategy
